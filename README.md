# Introduction to Machine Learning (by Duke University)

[Coursera link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-duke/home/info)

## About this Course

This course will provide you a foundational understanding of machine learning models (logistic regression, multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, natural language processing, etc.) as well as demonstrate how these models can solve complex problems in a variety of industries, from medical diagnostics to image recognition to text prediction. In addition, we have designed practice exercises that will give you hands-on experience implementing these data science models on data sets. These practice exercises will teach you how to implement machine learning algorithms with PyTorch, open source libraries used by leading tech companies in the machine learning field (e.g., Google, NVIDIA, CocaCola, eBay, Snapchat, Uber and many more).

## Run code

Create and activate conda environment:
```sh
conda create -n intro-to-ML-coursera python=3.10
conda activate intro-to-ML-coursera
```

Install

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


```sh
python -m IPython
```

### Set-up

If you'd like to run these examples on your own machine, we've provided installation instructions in [1A_PyTorch_Installation.ipynb](week1/1A_PyTorch_Installation.ipynb).
We'll be spending most of our time coding in IPython notebooks; if you haven't used an IPython notebook before, [1B_Coding_Environments.ipynb](week1/1B_Coding_Environments.ipynb) will give you a quick primer, as well as a few alternatives.
